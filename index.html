      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        I am in the final year of my Master’s in Physics at ETH Zurich, specializing in analytical and computational methods 
        for solving quantum many-body problems, including renormalization group techniques as well as various Quantum Monte Carlo 
        methods and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_network" target="_blank">tensor networks</a>. My most recent endevors include Deep Learning and I am currently exploring its applications.
        My current Master’s thesis focuses on quantum many-body scars and their stability under perturbations of the Hamiltonian or their state.
        I aim to get an understanding of the continuum limit of these systems with tensor networks or other algorithmic approaches.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alongside my studies, I have accumulated years of professional development experience,
        working on projects that range from electronics, embedded systems and data pipelines to web-based statistical data analysis solutions. 
      </p>
        I have also extensive cultural knowledge after having lived on four different continents and being able to speak multiple languages including German, 
        Chinese, English, Arabic and a good amount of Spanish and Portuguese.

      <h2>Academic Focus</h2>
      <ul>
        During my Bachelor’s and Master’s studies at ETH Zurich, my coursework was more theoretically inclined, with a focus on:
        <li><strong>Statistical Physics:</strong> exploring emergent behaviors and complex systems. I am particularly fascinated by phase transitions 
        and the scale-invariant behavior of systems approaching critical points. </li>
        <li><strong>Condensed Matter Physics:</strong> studying electronic structure and condensed matter phenomena.</li>
        <li><strong>Conformal Field Theory:</strong> Quantum Field Theories with conformal symmetry and its applications</li>
      </ul>

      <p>My most recent <a href="papers/seminar.pdf" target="_blank"> seminar paper</a> dealt with the Coset Construction of the N=2
      Superconformal Unitary Series and how its simple currents can be applied to achieve many projections commonly found in supersymmetric string theories, specifically 
      for ensuring worldsheet supersymmetry and spacetime supersymmetry. The second part of the paper deals with Gepner models which are exactly solvable supersymmetric string theories. </p>

      <p>My <a href="papers/thesis.pdf" target="_blank">Bachelor’s thesis</a> is about the development of a FPGA-based metal detector for humanitarian demining. It uses
      Electromagnetic Field Induction Spectroscopy to identify metallic objects underground. The signal processing and classification algorithms are implemented on a Xilinx FPGA.</p>

          <h3><a href="https://github.com/Nadjmu/guitar_0" target="_blank">Guitar Improvisation Tool </a></h3>
          <p>This tool was designed to see the common patterns of music-theoretical elements on the guitar fretboard thereby giving 
            a visual component to music theory. It helps with the simplest elements such as a single note and goes to more complex ones such as chords and scales.
            The tool is entirely built in python and uses Streamlit, a rather unconvential use case for it.

          <h3><a href="https://github.com/Nadjmu/soccer-robot" target="_blank">Autonomous driving soccer robot for the RoboCup Junior Lightweight League </a></h3>
          <p>My team and I built a soccer robot for one of the worlds largest competition for autonomous driving robots RoboCupJunior. 
            I was responsible for the software development and the electronic board design of the robot, which included writing the control algorithms in C++ 
            and interfacing with various sensors (infrared, ultrasonic, camera, IMU, etc. ) and actuators (motors) over various peripherals (I2C, SPI, Serial) and wireless communication between the robots (Bluetooth). 
            The board design was done with EDA software Eagle. The rules are according to: <a href="https://junior.robocup.org/soccer/" target="_blank">https://junior.robocup.org/soccer/</a>.

          <h3><a href="https://github.com/Nadjmu/ara" target="_blank">Time Series Data Analysis Tool </a></h3>
          <p>This tool was designed to do data-analysis for large datasets with tens of thousands of rows and dozens of columns of uniformly sampled environmental,
            operational and biochemical data without having to rewrite code all the time. It includes sections about all important statistical measures as well as 
            Time-Series-Decomposition and Correlations. It was entirely written with Streamlit. </aside></p>

          <h3><a href="https://github.com/Nadjmu/FPGA-based-metal-detector.git" target="_blank">FPGA-based metal detector for ordnance detection </a></h3>
          <p>The project aims to detect unexploded ordnance by using Electromagnetic Field Induction Spectroscopy and leveraging the parallel processing 
            capabilities of a FPGA. I got to learn about hardware description languages and signal decomposition techniques</p>

          <h3><a href="https://github.com/Nadjmu/DMSP" target="_blank">System Development for Resarch Module Dynamic Mobile Sensing Platform</a></h3>
          <p>I selected the necessary hardware components (microcontroller and sensors) and wrote the software in C. The project aims to capture 
            high-resolution uniformly sampled GPS and IMU data for deep learning research in the field of structural engineering. I dealt with peripherals 
            such as I2C and SPI, Real-time operating systems such as FreeRTOS, IoT Platforms such as Blynk and got a little bit familiar with TinyML by 
            working with Tensorflow Lite

          <p>I used Wireshark to decript the incoming TCP packets of the machine and wrote a C++ program which sends the same commands like a commerical software.
            I built a GUI using PyQT5 to control the DA100 Main Unit and log data into a InfluxDB database.

      <h2>Yiming Li</h2>
      <p>
        I am in the final year of my Master’s in Physics, specializing in <strong>Statistical Physics</strong> and 
        <strong>Solid State Physics</strong> with a particular affinity for phase transitions. My academic and research interests lie at the intersection of 
        <strong>physics, computation, and machine learning</strong>—specifically in applying modern AI techniques 
        to model and understand complex systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alongside my studies, I have accumulated <strong>years of professional development experience</strong>,
        working on projects that range from embedded systems and data pipelines to web-based solutions. 
        I enjoy bridging scientific rigor with software engineering practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m passionate about combining scientific analysis with real-world applications and am currently
        exploring opportunities that merge <strong>AI and physics.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, my international background has equipped me with strong cross-cultural communication skills
        after having lived, studied, and worked across four continents and being proficient in Chinese, 
        English, German, Spanish and Arabic. As a result, I orchestrated successful commercial agreements between 
        Chinese and European firms as a lead translator, mediator, and cultural liaison. 
        I am now expanding my services to new sectors and I am open for business and ready to help your company navigate cross-cultural deals. 
        Please feel free to contact me to discuss your needs.

      <h2>Academic Focus</h2>
      <ul>
        During my Bachelor’s and Master’s studies at ETH Zurich, my coursework was more theoretically inclined, with a focus on:
        <li><strong>Statistical Physics:</strong> exploring emergent behaviors and complex systems.</li>
        <li><strong>Solid State Physics:</strong> studying electronic structure and condensed matter phenomena.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>My most recent <a href="papers/seminar.pdf" target="_blank"> seminar paper</a> dealt with the Coset Construction of the N=2
      Superconformal Unitary Series and how its simple currents can be applied to achieve many necessary projects commonly found in supersymmetric string theories, 
      specifically in the context of Gepner models. </p>

      <p>My <a href="papers/thesis.pdf" target="_blank">Bachelor’s thesis</a> is about the development of a FPGA-based metal detector for humanitarian demining. It uses
      Electromagnetic Field Induction Spectroscopy to identify metallic objects underground. The signal processing and classification algorithms are implemented on a Xilinx FPGA.</p>

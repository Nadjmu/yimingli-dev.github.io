      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am in the final year of my Master’s in Physics, specializing in <strong>Statistical Physics</strong> and 
        <strong>Solid State Physics</strong> with a particular affinity for phase transitions. My academic and research interests lie at the intersection of 
        <strong>physics, computation, and machine learning</strong>—specifically in applying modern AI techniques 
        to model and understand complex systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alongside my studies, I have accumulated <strong>years of professional development experience</strong>,
        working on projects that range from embedded systems and data pipelines to web-based solutions. 
        I enjoy bridging scientific rigor with software engineering practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m passionate about combining scientific analysis with real-world applications and am currently
        exploring opportunities that merge <strong>AI and physics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, my international background has equipped me with strong cross-cultural communication skills
        after having lived, studied, and worked across <strong>four continents</strong> and being proficient in Chinese, 
        English, German, Spanish and Arabic. As a result, I orchestrated successful commercial agreements between 
        Chinese and European firms as a lead translator, mediator, and cultural liaison. 
        I am now expanding my services to new sectors and I am open for business and ready to help your company navigate cross-cultural deals. 
        Please feel free to contact me to discuss your needs.

      <h2>Global Experience</h2>
      <p>
        Having lived and studied on <strong>four continents</strong>, I bring a deep appreciation for cultural diversity
        and interdisciplinary collaboration. I am <strong>proficient in five languages</strong> and have professional
        experience working as a <strong>translator and mediator</strong> between European businesses and Chinese clients.
      </p>
      <p>
        This global background has strengthened my ability to work across different cultures, adapt to diverse environments,
        and navigate both technical and interpersonal challenges with sensitivity and clarity.

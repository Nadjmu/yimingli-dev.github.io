      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        I am in the final year of my Master’s in Physics at ETH Zurich, specializing in <strong>Statistical Physics</strong> and 
        <strong>Solid State Physics</strong> with a particular affinity for phase transitions. My academic and research interests lie at the intersection of 
        <strong>physics, computation, and machine learning</strong>—specifically in applying modern AI techniques 
        to model and understand complex systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alongside my studies, I have accumulated <strong>years of professional development experience</strong>,
        working on projects that range from embedded systems and data pipelines to web-based solutions. 
        I enjoy bridging scientific rigor with software engineering practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m passionate about combining scientific analysis with real-world applications and am currently
        exploring opportunities that merge <strong>AI and physics.</strong>
      </p>
      <!--
      <p>
        Furthermore, my international background has equipped me with strong cross-cultural communication skills
        after having lived, studied, and worked across four continents and being proficient in 
        English, Chinese, German, Spanish and Arabic. As a result, I orchestrated successful commercial agreements between 
        European and Chinese firms as a lead translator, mediator, and cultural liaison. 
        I am now expanding my services to new sectors and I am open for business and ready to help your company navigate cross-cultural deals. 
        Please feel free to contact me to discuss your needs.

      <h2>Academic Focus</h2>
      <ul>
        During my Bachelor’s and Master’s studies at ETH Zurich, my coursework was more theoretically inclined, with a focus on:
        <li><strong>Statistical Physics:</strong> exploring emergent behaviors and complex systems.</li>
        <li><strong>Solid State Physics:</strong> studying electronic structure and condensed matter phenomena.</li>
        <li><strong>Conformal Field Theory:</strong> Quantum Field Theories with conformal symmetry and its applications</li>
      </ul>

      <p>My most recent <a href="papers/seminar.pdf" target="_blank"> seminar paper</a> dealt with the Coset Construction of the N=2
      Superconformal Unitary Series and how its simple currents can be applied to achieve many projections commonly found in supersymmetric string theories, specifically 
      for ensuring worldsheet supersymmetry and spacetime supersymmetry. The second part of the paper deals with Gepner models which are exactly solvable supersymmetric string theories. </p>

      <p>My <a href="papers/thesis.pdf" target="_blank">Bachelor’s thesis</a> is about the development of a FPGA-based metal detector for humanitarian demining. It uses
      Electromagnetic Field Induction Spectroscopy to identify metallic objects underground. The signal processing and classification algorithms are implemented on a Xilinx FPGA.</p>

        <div class="card">
          <h3><a href="https://github.com/Nadjmu/ara" target="_blank">Time Series Data Analysis Tool </a></h3>
          <p>This tool was designed to do data-analysis for large datasets with tens of thousands of rows and dozens of columns of uniformly sampled environmental,
            operational and biochemical data without having to rewrite code all the time. It includes sections about all important statistical measures as well as 
            Time-Series-Decomposition and Correlations. It was entirely written with Streamlit. </aside></p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3><a href="https://github.com/Nadjmu/guitar_0" target="_blank">Guitar Improvisation Tool </a></h3>
          <p>This tool was designed to see the common patterns of music-theoretical elements on the guitar fretboard thereby giving 
            a visual component to music theory. It helps with the simplest elements such as a single note to more complex ones such as chords and scales.
            The tool is entirely built in python and uses Streamlit, a rather unconvential use case for it.

          <h3><a href="https://github.com/Nadjmu/FPGA-based-metal-detector.git" target="_blank">FPGA-based metal detector for ordnance detection </a></h3>
          <p>The project aims to detect unexploded ordnance by using Electromagnetic Field Induction Spectroscopy and leveraging the parallel processing 
            capabilities of a FPGA. I got to learn about hardware description languages and signal decomposition techniques</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3><a href="https://github.com/Nadjmu/DMSP" target="_blank">System Development for Resarch Module Dynamic Mobile Sensing Platform</a></h3>
          <p>I selected the necessary hardware components (microcontroller and sensors) and wrote the software in C. The project aims to capture 
            high-resolution uniformly sampled GPS and IMU data for deep learning research in the field of structural engineering. I dealt with peripherals 
            such as I2C and SPI, Real-time operating systems such as FreeRTOS, IoT Platforms such as Blynk and got a little bit familiar with TinyML by 
            working with Tensorflow Lite

          <h3><a href="https://github.com/Nadjmu/yokodaq" target="_blank">Fullstack development for the data acquisition unit 
            Yokogawa DA100 Main Unit
          </a></h3>
          <p>I used Wireshark to decript the incoming TCP packets of the machine and wrote a C++ program which sends the same commands like a commerical software.
            I built a GUI using PyQT5 to control the DA100 Main Unit and log data into a InfluxDB database.
